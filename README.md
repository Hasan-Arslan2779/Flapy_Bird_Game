# Flappy Bird Game

This is a project that includes the Flappy Bird game, a clone of a simple web browser game using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

## How to play

The game is based on a very simple logic. You control a bird in the game and the goal is to survive as long as possible by passing the bird through obstacles.

The bird is controlled by jumping upwards. When you click on the screen or press the space key, the bird will jump upwards. In order for the bird not to fall, you must try to move forward by passing through the obstacles. You earn points for each hurdle you pass. The aim of the game is to get the highest score. When you hit the walls or the floor in the game, the game is over and you start over.
